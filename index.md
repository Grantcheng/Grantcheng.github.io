**Hong Cheng** received the B.S degree in electronic and information engineering from School of Communications and Electronics at Jiangxi Science and Technology Normal University, Nanchang, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D.degree in Mathematics from the Department of Mathematics and Institute of Natural Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2015. Now, he is an assistant professor at Shanghai LiXin University of Accounting and Finance. His research interests computational and theoretical neuroscience, include understanding of the relation between structure and functions of biological neuronal networks, discovery of potential mechanisms underlying information processing in the brain, and statistic and machine learning applications in medical image processing, especially the quantile regression causality in neuronal network. He is a member of the CCF, 2016 Shanghai "Sailing Scholar".
