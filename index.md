**Hong Cheng** received the B.S degree in electronic and information
engineering from School of Communications and Electronics at Jiangxi Science
and Technology Normal University, Nanchang, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D.
degree in Mathematics from the Department of Mathematics and Institute of
Natural Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2015. Now,
he is a assistant professor at Shanghai LiXin University of Accounting and
Finance. His research interests computational and theoretical neuroscience,
include understanding of the relation between structure and functions of
biological neuronal networks, discovery of potential mechanisms underlying
information processing in the brain, and statistic and machine learning
applications in medical image processing ,especially the quantile regression
causality in neuronal network.  He is a member of the CCF.
